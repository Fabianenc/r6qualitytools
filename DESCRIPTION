Description: A comprehensive suite of statistical tools for Quality
    Management, designed around the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and
    Control (DMAIC) cycle used in Six Sigma methodology. Based on the work
    of Thomas Roth, the package enhances his original design by
    refactoring classes to R6 object-oriented programming for increased
    flexibility and performance. It replaces traditional graphics with
    modern, interactive visualizations using ggplot2 and plotly. Built on
    tidyverse principles, it simplifies data manipulation and
    visualization, offering an intuitive approach to quality science.
