\usage{
fracDesign(
  k = 3,
  p = 0,
  gen = NULL,
  replicates = 1,
  blocks = 1,
  centerCube = 0,
  random.seed = 1234
)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Numeric value giving the number of factors. By default \code{k} is set to ‘3’.}

\item{p}{Numeric integer between ‘0’ and ‘7’. p is giving the number of additional factors in the response surface design by aliasing effects.
A 2^k-p factorial design will be generated and the generators of the standard designs available in fracChoose() will be used.
By default p is set to ‘0’. Any other value will cause the function to omit the argument gen given by the user and replace it by the one out of the table of standard designs (see: \code{\link{fracChoose}}).
Replicates and blocks can be set anyway!}

\item{gen}{One or more defining relations for a fractional factorial design, for example:  \code{"C=AB"}. By default gen is set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{replicates}{Numeric value giving the number of replicates per factor combination. By default \code{replicates} is set to ‘1’.}

\item{blocks}{Numeric value giving the number of blocks. By default blocks is set to ‘1’.}

\item{centerCube}{Numeric value giving the number of center points within the 2^k design. By default \code{centerCube} is set to ‘0’.}

\item{random.seed}{Seed for randomization of the design}
}
\value{
The function \code{fracDesign} returns an object of class \code{\link{facDesign.c}}.
}
\description{
Generates a 2^k-p fractional factorial design.

\examples{
#Example 1
#Returns a 2^4-1 fractional factorial design. Factor D will be aliased with
vp.frac = fracDesign(k = 4, gen = "D=ABC")
#the three-way-interaction ABC (i.e. I = ABCD)
vp.frac$.response(rnorm(2^(4-1)))
# summary of the fractional factorial design
vp.frac$summary()

#Example 2
#Returns a full factorial design with 3 replications per factor combination and 4 center points
vp.rep = fracDesign(k = 3, replicates = 3, centerCube = 4)
#Summary of the replicated fractional factorial design
vp.rep$summary()
