  \item {"L9_3" for four three-level factors.}
  \item {"L12_2" for 11 two-level factors.}
  \item {"L16_2" for 16 two-level factors}
  \item {"L16_4" for 16 four-level factors.}
  \item {"L18_2_3" for one two-level and seven three-level factors.}
  \item {"L25_5" for six five-level factors.}
  \item {"L27_3" for 13 three-level factors.}
  \item {"L32_2" for 32 two-level factors.}
  \item {"L32_2_4" for one two-level factor and nine four-level factors.}
  \item {"L36_2_3_a" for 11 two-level factors and 12 three-level factors.}
  \item {"L36_2_3_b" for three two-level factors and 13 three-level factors.}
  \item {"L50_2_5" for one two-level factor and eleven five-level factors.}
  \item {"L8_4_2" for one four-level factor and four two-level factors.}
  \item {"L16_4_2_a" for one four-level factor and 12 two-level factors.}
  \item {"L16_4_2_b" for two four-level factors and nine two-level factors.}
  \item {"L16_4_2_c" for three four-level factors and six two-level factors.}
  \item {"L16_4_2_d" for five four-level factors and two two-level factors.}
  \item {"L18_6_3" for one six-level factor and six three-level factors.}
}}

\item{randomize}{A logical value (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) that specifies whether to randomize the RunOrder of the design.
By default, \code{randomize} is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{replicates}{An integer specifying the number of replicates for each run in the design.}
}
\value{
A \code{taguchiDesign} returns an object of class \code{taguchiDesign}.
}
\description{
Function to create a taguchi design.
}
\details{
An overview of possible taguchi designs is possible with \code{taguchiChoose}.
